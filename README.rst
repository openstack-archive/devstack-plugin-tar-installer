===============================

By default DevStack installs all the software needed to run OpenStack from the OS' repository, however sometimes there is a need to test OpenStack against the latest (or custom) versions of specific software programs (e.g., qemu and libvirt).

Please feel here a long description which must be at least 3 lines wrapped on
80 cols, so that distribution package maintainers can use it in their packages.
Note that this is a hard requirement.
